* Building the Tracer:

On Linux systems with gcc(1) installed, the JVMTI agent can be easily compiled into
a shared library:

> gcc -shared -o tracer.so -I${JAVA_HOME}/../include -I${JAVA_HOME}/../include/linux tracer.c

On other Unix-like systems, only the second directory containing Linux-specific
header files should need to be adapted.

* Using the Tracer:

The Tracer writes the method trace into a file, which it opens at VM start-up.
This file need to be passed to the JVMTI agent as a command line argument:

> java -agentpath:./tracer.so=<file>

The resulting file contains tab-separated records easily processed with awk(1).
Each entry starts with "CALL", followed by one triple of type descriptor, method
name, and method descriptor. This triple designates the called method. It is
followed by either a second triple, designating the calling method, or the
string "ROOT", which indicates that the method has been called from outside
Java-space.
